  # 1. Selects the Pods this policy applies to (your Flask app)
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-report
  
  # 2. Defines what types of traffic are allowed (Ingress and Egress)
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress

  # --- INGRESS (INBOUND) RULES ---
  ingress:
    # Rule 1: Allow internal traffic (from Kube-system components like health checks)
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector: {} # Allows traffic from all namespaces (useful for EKS CNI/Node communication)
        # ⚠️ NOTE: In a strictly secured environment, you would restrict this to specific namespaces (e.g., kube-system)
      
    # Rule 2: Restrict Ingress Ports
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5000 # Only allow traffic destined for the Flask container port (5000)

  # --- EGRESS (OUTBOUND) RULES ---
  # Default is DENY ALL. Only specific destinations are whitelisted below.
  egress:
    # Rule 1: Allow DNS Resolution (TCP and UDP on port 53)
    # This is essential for EKS, AWS service endpoints, and pulling ECR images
